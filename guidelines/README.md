### What is this?

We wrote the following guidelines in order to insure a very simple workflow between all the people in charge of design between the Wagons all over the world. As we would love to see a continuity and an ever growing quality among our graphic assets, Github seems to be the right place to centralize them and gather your feedbacks.

#### How does it work?

We organised them by **type**. For exemple, in the following directory : [AperoTalk](https://github.com/lewagon/design/tree/master/guidelines/aperotalk), you will find all the assets needed to organise and spread the news on the web when you pull one off ! (YouTube thumbnails, Facebook annoucement...)

#### Hum... I'd like to change something.

If you're up for a change, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lewagon/design/issues/new) and ask for an update this way :

```
[Catégorie] Template

Exemple Apero Talk :
[AperoTalk] Update YouTube Thumbnail

Exemple Workshop :
[Workshop] Update Main Image
```


#### Yurk !

Thoses assets are made with love at Le Wagon Paris. However there's no accounting for taste. If you'd like to suggest something else please [open an issue](https://github.com/lewagon/design/issues/new) and ask for an update this way :

```
[Catégorie] Template

Exemple Apero Talk :
[AperoTalk] Update YouTube Thumbnail

Exemple Workshop :
[Workshop] Update Main Image
```


#### Feeling inspired ? Welcome !

This is great ! In the same way developers use the gitflow feel free to do it too. Create a new branch and add the new template in its category then [open an issue](https://github.com/lewagon/design/issues/new) in order to inform the team members and get feedbacks!

Then create a pull-request. Do not hesite to show your work. Never!
